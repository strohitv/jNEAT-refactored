# JNEAT (NEAT Java) refactored
This project is an attempt to refactor the original source code of JNEAT from the university of texas into a more modern style and make it easier to use (for example as a maven library).  
The original source code was released under the GNU GPLv2 license and can be downloaded here: http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?jneat 

## current todos
- refactor the original sources in the jneat folder
- create unit tests
- make the project a maven project and change the project structure accordingly
